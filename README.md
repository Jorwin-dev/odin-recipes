Project 1: Recipes
This current project will allow me to practice the basics of HTML that I have learned. I will be building a basic recipe website, simply consisting of a main index which will provide links to a few recipes.
I will have demonstrated my basic ability with HTML, the understanding of its syntax, and also the use of git commands(commits and such) to keep track of my workflow.
